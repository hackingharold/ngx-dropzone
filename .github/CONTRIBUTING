# Welcome to our contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! We would love for you to contribute and make it even betterÂ âœ¨. Please read ourÂ [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT)Â to keep our community open and respectable. ðŸ’–

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR. Additionally, we lay out some general coding rules.

Since we are using the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), check up on [Setting up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) and [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests) if you are completely new to Open Source development. To get an overview of the project, read theÂ [README](./../README.md).

## Getting started

Participating on a project probably starts at the issues section.

### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with our package,Â search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue. If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us byÂ submitting an issueÂ to ourÂ GitHub Repository. We might ask you to provide a minimal reproduction example to support our research. Or even better, you canÂ submit a Pull RequestÂ with a fix.

### Solve an issue

Scan through ourÂ existing issuesÂ to find one that interests you. Check out one of our issues labeled asÂ [help wanted](https://github.com/hackingharold/ngx-dropzone/labels/help%20wanted)Â orÂ [good first issue](https://github.com/hackingharold/ngx-dropzone/labels/good%20first%20issue). As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Missing a feature?

You canÂ *request*Â a new feature byÂ submitting an issueÂ to our GitHub Repository. If you would like toÂ *implement*Â a new major feature, please open an issue first and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This process allows us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

Smaller features may be built by you directly and submitted as a pull request.

## Local Development

To contribute actual code, fork the repository and create a new working branch. When committing, please adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) ruleset. Other syntax-specific requirements will be enforced by the projectâ€™s linter.

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

- All features or bug fixesÂ **must be tested**Â by one or more specs (unit-tests).
- All public API methodsÂ **must be documented**.

## Pull Request

Before jumping into a PR be sure to searchÂ existing PRsÂ orÂ issuesÂ for an open or closed item that relates to your submission.

### Submitting the PR

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- If youâ€™re solving an issue, don't forget toÂ link the PR to it.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either usingÂ suggested changesÂ or pull request comments. You can make any changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation asÂ resolved.
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout thisÂ [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts)Â to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

Our team thanks you as you are now part of our contributors community. Once your PR is merged, your contributions will probably be publicly visible on the next package release. âœ¨
